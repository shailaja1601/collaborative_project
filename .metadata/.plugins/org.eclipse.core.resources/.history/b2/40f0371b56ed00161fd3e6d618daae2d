In 2014, Monster mPower Search was voted Product of the Year under the 'Online Job Portals category' in a survey of over 18000 people. Monster India and DishTV partnered in convergence of the Internet and TV medium to make job services accessible to TV viewers across all cities, bridging the unmet need of the audience for whom access to the internet is limited. This first ever job search initiative is called 'Monsterjobs Active'.
The Indian Air Force Placement Cell (IAFPC) selected Monster India for a collaboration to provide a robust platform to assist retired and shortly retiring Air Warriors seek suitable second career opportunities in the corporate world. Monster initiated the 'Rozgarduniya.com' to bridge the gap between rural youth and job opportunities.
